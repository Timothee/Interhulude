Yay! Except that it got the attention of Hulu's team which worked to counter the extension.

In particular, they added the following:

    var a = "#NoHuluAdsMask"; 
    $.client && $.client.browser == "Chrome" && window.setInterval(function() {
    var b = document.location;
    if (!/\/watch\/(\d+)/.test(b.pathname)) return;
    var c = $(a);
    c.length > 0 && c.remove();
    }, (new Date).getTime() % 2e3 + 2e3);

and removed some of their player's APIs, namely `getCurrentState`, `mute` and `pauseVideo`, removing all hope of working around that again.

Fair game.

It was fun while it lastedâ€¦

This is thus for educational purposes only.

Hello there,

this is just a few lines of JavaScript that mutes the ads on Hulu, packaged in a Chrome extension.

In more details: the ads will be automatically muted and masked when
they come on, and unmasked when the commercial break is over. If desired,
it will also pause the video when the break is over, so you can
step out with the knowledge that you won't miss anything.
